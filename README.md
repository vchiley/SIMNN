# SIMNN
Simple Neural Network (SIMNN) is a personal project in which I implement a Simple Neural Network library based on my understanding of Neural Networks, mostly learned in ECE 271B, Discriminant Learning
This will not be an extensive or optimized library which can be run with GPU's, this is rather a simple NN implementation which is easily human readable. Written in python using numpy for simplicity.
An example of how to use it can be found as a ipython notebook in example.ipynb

SIMNN has implimented:
- NN model
- layers
	- Linear
		- bias in the Linear Layer (might be buggy)
	- Conv (planned)
	- Dropout (planned)
- activations
	- Sigmoid
	- Softmax
	- ReLU
- costs
	- CrossEntropy
	- SquareEror
A environment.yml file is provided which describes my current environment.
