# SIMNN
Simple Neural Network (SIMNN) is a personal project in which I implement a Simple Neural Network library based on my understanding of Neural Networks. This understanding was mostly aquired from Professor Manuela Vasconcelos in ECE 271B, Discriminant Learning and using NN libraries.  
This will not be an extensive or optimized library which can be run with GPU's, this is rather a simple NN implementation which is easily human readable. Written in python using numpy for simplicity.  
An example of how to use it can be found as an ipython notebook in example.ipynb

SIMNN has implemented:
- NN model
- layers
	- Linear
		- bias in the Linear Layer (planned)
		- weight regularization (planned)
	- Conv (planned)
	- Dropout (planned)
- activations
	- Sigmoid
	- Softmax
	- ReLU
- costs
	- CrossEntropy
	- SquareEror
An environment.yml file is provided which describes my current environment.
